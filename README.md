# GuardDog: Guard Your Time

## Installation
1. Go to chrome://extensions/ on Chrome
2. Enable "Developer mode" in the top-right corner
3. Click "Load unpacked" in the top-left corner
4. Choose the GuardDog folder

## Doggofy 
Go to a page with images and see what happens when you click the dog icon :)

## Guard List
When you register sites, just put the name rather than the url.
For example, just type in "reddit", instead of "https://www.reddit.com/".

## Grace Period
Set the grace period by typing in a number.
This number will be the number of minutes allowed on any of the sites on the Guard List.
Once the grace period has passed, GuardDog will "doggofy" your page so that you can get back to your tasks!
